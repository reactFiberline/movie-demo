## Getting started

1. Add Victory to your project:

  ```sh
  $ npm install victory --save
  ```

2. Add your first Victory component:

  ```js
  import React, { Component } from 'react';
  import { render } from 'react-dom';
  import { VictoryPie } from 'victory';

  class PieChart extends Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <VictoryPie />
      );
    }
  }

  render(<PieChart />, document.getElementById('app'));
  ```

3. `VictoryPie` component will be rendered, and you should see:

</p>

## Requirements
Projects using Victory should also depend on [React][] and [prop-types][].

## Victory Native
Want to use `Victory` with React Native? Check out [victory-native](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-native)
Victory Native shares most of its code with Victory, and has a nearly identical api!

## Contributing

The `victory` repo aggregates stable victory components that are developed in other repos. The `victory`
repo is only updated with new releases, but the following repos are under very active development.

[`victory-core`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-core)
[`victory-chart`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart)
[`victory-pie`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-pie)

Please review our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/builder-victory-component/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributor-covenant-code-of-conduct) before contributing.

For a detailed contribution guide, please see [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/builder-victory-component-dev/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the project builder archetype.


```sh
# Clone the Victory repo
$ git clone git@github.com:FormidableLabs/victory.git
$ cd victory

# Run the demo app server
$ npm start

# Open the demo app
$ open http://localhost:3000

# Run checks (lint and tests)
$ npm test
```
### Multi-repo development

Victory uses [`lank`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/lank) for multi-repo development. Use a lank workflow to test changes in victory dependencies. Here's an example of setting up lank to test changes in `victory-core` from `victory-chart`

**First, make sure that all of your Victory repos are _siblings_ in the same directory**

```sh
# Install lank globally
$ npm install -g lank
```
Victory repos are already configured with appropriate `.lankrc` and lank scripts. To test changes in `victory-core` from `victory-chart`:

```sh
# Run all commands from the root of `victory-chart`
$ cd victory-chart

# Run `lank link` to remove `victory-core` from node_modules
$ lank link

# Watch for changes to lanked repos. Leave this process running in its own terminal window
$ npm run lank-watch

# Run a dev server with your lanked repos. In a new terminal window...
$ npm run lank-run
```

Refresh your browser to pick up changes.

For more on the development environment, see [DEVELOPMENT](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/builder-victory-component/blob/master/dev/DEVELOPMENT.md) in the project builder archetype.

## Important

_This project is in alpha release. We're hard at work fixing bugs and improving the API. Be prepared for breaking changes!_

**SEMVER** Minor version bumps should be considered breaking changes until we hit v1.0.0. Patches can be considered safe.

**Caveats** git installs using npm 2 may fail in postinstall. If you are consuming Victory via git installs please use npm >=3.0.0

## Issues
### Jest Snapshots

If you want to use [Jest snapshot testing](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/addons/storyshots)
with Victory, you may encounter a problem where the Jest snapshot changes every time, due to a randomly generated `clipId`
being used for a `VictoryClipContainer` group component.
The solution to this is to set a static `clipId` on your `VictoryClipContainer`.

For example, when creating a `VictoryLine` component, you can pass a `groupComponent` prop:
```js
<VictoryLine
  groupComponent={<VictoryClipContainer clipId={1} />}
/>
```

Now the `clipId` attached to your `VictoryLine` component will always be the same, and your snapshot will not change with each test run.
