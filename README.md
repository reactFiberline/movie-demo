# movie-demo 
This is a version of [this movie demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/5zk7x551vk) that lets you inspect some of the fiber operations that are happening under the hood.  Fiber is *intense*, it is complicated and has a lot of nuance to it. This tool is a great way to start understanding how things will work with the new architecture!

## Getting Started
### Step 1
Watch [react-fiberline](https://github.com/reactFiberline/react-fiberline) to get the visualizer when it is released.

### Step 2
Setup the Website

1. `git clone https://github.com/reactFiberline/movie-demo.git`
2. No need to install dependencies (which is why it's so big)
3. `cd movie-demo`
4. `npm start`

### Step 3
Inspect the website, it will run on `localhost:3000`

1. Open the console in your browser
2. `fiberData.fiberlineEvents` will display an object with the chronological events
